**Problem**

Create `Shapes` and have a method called `area()` using polymorphism.

**Implementation**

* Create a superclass named `Shapes` that has a method called `area()`.
* Subclasses of `Shapes` can be `circle` and `Rectangle`.
* Each subclass has its way of calculating area. Using Inheritance and Polymorphism means, the subclasses can use the `area()` method to find the area’s **formula** for that shape.

```java
class Main {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
 
  }
}
```
