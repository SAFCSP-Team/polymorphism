**Problem**

Create `Bank` and have a method called `getRateOfInterest()` using the polymorphism concept.

**Implementation**

* Create a superclass named `Bank` that has a method called `getRateOfInterest()`.
* Subclasses of `Back` can be `SNB` and `SAB`.
* Each subclass has its way of calculating the Rate Of Interest.
* the subclasses can use the `getRateOfInterest()` method to find the rate for that bank.
* print the Rate Of Interest for each bank in the main method.

```java
class Main {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
  }
}
```
