**Problem**

Create “Shapes” and has a method called “area()” usning polymorphism.

**Implementation**
* Create superclass named “Shapes” has a method called “area()”.
* Subclasses of “Shapes” can be “circle”, “Rectangle”.
* Each subclass has its way of calculating area. Using Inheritance and Polymorphism means, the subclasses can use the “area()” method to find the area’s formula for that shape.

```java
class Main {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
 
  }
}
```
